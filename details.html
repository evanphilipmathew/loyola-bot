                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Language is a tool that is
                        used daily by countless humans across the globe. As a
                        society, people interact with each other as individuals
                        or as groups on a continuous basis. This interaction is
                        supported by language in its different forms.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Common interactions between
                        people can be <b>automated</b><span
                            style="font-weight: 400;">. By using computer algorithms<span
                                style="font-weight: 400;">, or a series of
                                steps, a machine can be programmed to
                                participate in our human conversational
                                interactions. This program for communicating
                                with a digital device is what we call a
                                chatbot.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A chatbot is a
                                computer program that allows humans to interact
                                with a digital device as if they were
                                communicating with a real person. To better
                                understand how a chatbot works, you will
                                experiment with one. Let us start by talking to
                                our chatbot called
                               Lobo<b>.</b></span></p>

                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When searching for
                            answers to your questions, Lobo has a "Knowledge
                            Base" of information that it refers to. It can combine
                            this information in logical ways to answer
                            questions. For example, Lobo’s intelligence includes
                            the ability to reason with specific objects. If
                            someone asks “What is the admission procedure to Loyola School?” Lobo looks up
                            the properties for ‘admission.’ It finds the details of
                            ‘admissions’ and replies in detail.</span></p>

                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rule-based chatbots like
                            Vera can interact with humans using predetermined
                            questions, answers, and statements. This system
                            needs developers to code all the necessary message
                            processing and interaction logic by hand. This
                            method can work quite well, but the interaction with
                            the chatbot feels unnatural and limited. The
                            developer coding the application can only predict
                            and provide so many different options to the
                            program. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">

                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To solve the problem of

                            scientists created a newer and more powerful tool,
                            Artificial Intelligence (AI). </span><b>Machine
                            learning</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a
                            branch of AI and can be defined as the capability of
                            a machine to learn from examples. For this process,
                            the developer needs a lot of data (i.e.
                            conversations) to support the machine to identify
                            the best answer to a given question.</span></p>

                            examples of chatbots that use AI machine learning to
                            help them understand what the user is
