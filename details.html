                        used daily by countless humans across the globe. As a
                        society, people interact with each other as individuals
                        or as groups on a continuous basis. This interaction is
                        supported by language in its different forms.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Common interactions between
                        people can be <b>automated</b><span
                            style="font-weight: 400;">. By using computer algorithms<span
                                style="font-weight: 400;">, or a series of
                                steps, a machine can be programmed to
                                participate in our human conversational
                                interactions. This program for communicating
                                with a digital device is what we call a
                                chatbot.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A chatbot is a
                                computer program that allows humans to interact
                                with a digital device as if they were
                                communicating with a real person. To better
                                understand how a chatbot works, you will
                                experiment with one. Let us start by talking to
                                our chatbot called

                            continuous loop that takes data, processes it,
                            produces a result, and in most cases provides that
                            result to the system to improve its learning.

                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI starts and is defined
                            by </span><b>data</b><span
                            style="font-weight: 400;">. These systems require
                            large quantities of information to help the machine
                            learn patterns and produce results that satisfy the
                            requirements of the developers. </span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data provided to the
                            system is processed by a </span><b>learning
                            algorithm</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that
                            extracts patterns and learns from the data provided.
                            The system creates a result, which varies depending
                            on the type of AI system being utilized. The loop is
                            closed by taking the result and feeding it back to
                            the learning algorithm for further processing or
