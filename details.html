<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Language is a tool that is used daily by countless humans across the globe. As a society, people interact with each other as individuals or as groups on a continuous basis. This interaction is supported by language in its different forms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Common interactions between people can be </span><b>automated</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. By using computer </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/insights/2014/09/artificial-intelligence-algorithms-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">algorithms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or a series of steps, a machine can be programmed to participate in our human conversational interactions. This program for communicating with a digital device is what we call a chatbot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A chatbot is a computer program that allows humans to interact with a digital device as if they were communicating with a real person. To better understand how a chatbot works, you will experiment with one. You’ll start by </span>talking to a very simple chatbot called Kuki<b>.</b></p>

													<h2>Activity 1: Talk To Kuki The Chatbot</h2>
																			<div><figure id="attachment_70344"  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-70344" src="https://www.sciencefriday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/word-bubble.jpeg" alt="A speech bubble shape formed by the placement of gold-colored pieces of paper on a dark green background." width="512" height="341" srcset="https://www.sciencefriday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/word-bubble.jpeg 512w, https://www.sciencefriday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/word-bubble.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://www.sciencefriday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/word-bubble.jpeg?resize=400,266 400w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Can you hold a conversation with a computer program? Photo by Volodymyr Hryshchenko on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/V5vqWC9gyEU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a>.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To begin, you will interact with the Kuki chatbot so that you better understand the interaction between people and this type of computer program. Every interaction relies on </span><b>listening</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>comprehending</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  Think of a typical conversation you may have with a friend and consider the following questions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is only one of you talking or do both of you exchange information?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are the two of you also listening?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are the words you hear creating thoughts in your mind?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you coming up with questions about the subject?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are questions to consider when a person is talking to another person. How can a conversation work when talking to a chatbot?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>NOTE:</strong> It is recommended that you explore Kuki the chatbot with the assistance of an adult, as it requires creating an account. If you are under 13 years of age, you are not authorized to use Kuki.</span></p>
<h3>What Should You Ask Kuki?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visit</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the chatbot </span><a href="https://www.kuki.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kuki</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and ask it any questions that you may have. You can try the questions posted below, or try some of your own.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Silly</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Why did the chicken cross the road?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Informative</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Why is the sky blue?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Data</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. How many people live in Iceland?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>History</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When did mankind land on the moon?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Personal</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Where are you from?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Ethical</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. What are you?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Nonsensical</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. What is the population of Mars?</span></li>
</ul>
<figure id="attachment_70436"  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-70436 size-full" src="https://www.sciencefriday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/kuki-1.png" alt="A computer screen shows an animated 3D rendering of a girl on the left and the start of the chatbot conversation on the right." width="1199" height="636" srcset="https://www.sciencefriday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/kuki-1.png 1199w, https://www.sciencefriday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/kuki-1.png?resize=300,159 300w, https://www.sciencefriday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/kuki-1.png?resize=768,407 768w, https://www.sciencefriday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/kuki-1.png?resize=1024,543 1024w, https://www.sciencefriday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/kuki-1.png?resize=400,212 400w" sizes="(max-width: 1199px) 100vw, 1199px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">What will you ask the chatbot, Kuki? Source: Screenshot of <a href="https://chat.kuki.ai/chat" target="_blank&quot;">Kuki</a>.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think about these questions as you chat with Kuki:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you feel interacting with Kuki?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does the conversation flow easily, or seem disconnected and difficult?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How can Kuki understand your questions?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where do you think the answers that Kuki provides are coming from? Are the answers pre-made and stored somewhere? Are the answers constructed by the program as you ask?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you think that creating this type of conversation is easy or hard? Why?</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Does It Work?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When searching for answers to your questions, Kuki has a “</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuki_AI" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowledge Base</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” of information that it refers to. It can combine this information in logical ways to answer questions. For example, Kuki’s intelligence includes the ability to reason with specific objects. If someone asks “Can you eat a house?” Kuki looks up the properties for ‘house.’ It finds the value of ‘made_from’ is set to ‘brick’ and replies ‘no,’ as a brick is not edible.</span></p>

<p>Who is a service provider? In this case the service provider a business that provide specific services or expertise to their clients—or users. In this case the chatbot engineers created a customized chatbot that answers routine questions for college students. University of Alberta is the service provider and the student (like you) is the user.</p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simple Rule-Based Chatbots</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rule-based chatbots like Vera can interact with humans using predetermined questions, answers, and statements. This system needs developers to code all the necessary message processing and interaction logic by hand. This method can work quite well, but the interaction with the chatbot feels unnatural and limited. The developer coding the application can only predict and provide so many different options to the program. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Does AI Do Its Job?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To solve the problem of not having enough choices and complexity, computer scientists created a newer and more powerful tool, Artificial Intelligence (AI). </span><b>Machine learning</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a branch of AI and can be defined as the capability of a machine to learn from examples. For this process, the developer needs a lot of data (i.e. conversations) to support the machine to identify the best answer to a given question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Kuki and Vera are examples of chatbots that use AI machine learning to help them understand what the user is asking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI starts and is defined by </span><b>data</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These systems require large quantities of information to help the machine learn patterns and produce results that satisfy the requirements of the developers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data provided to the system is processed by a </span><b>learning algorithm</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that extracts patterns and learns from the data provided. The system creates a result, which varies depending on the type of AI system being utilized. The loop is closed by taking the result and feeding it back to the learning algorithm for further processing or </span><b>learning</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most common types of results are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Predictions</strong>, eg. the weather, customer behavior, and engagement.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Generation</strong>, eg. creating text, an image, or a song.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Analysis</strong>, eg. checking for product quality in a production line.</span></li>
